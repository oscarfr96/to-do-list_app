# React Project Base

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This project was created to explore and learn React, covering everything from basic concepts to a functional application. It includes practical examples of component structures, state management, and various React features. Feel free to clone this repository, install dependencies, and run the app to explore its functionality.

## Project Features

- **Dynamic Components**: Component-based structure for an interactive and modular experience.
- **State Management**: Utilizes hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and effects within components.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ready for production with a fully optimized build.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It optimizes React for the best performance, creating minified files with unique names for easy deployment.
